This is a simple interactive application built with R Markdown and Shiny. Use the slider to change the number of observations in the histogram.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  sliderInput("num_obs", label = "Number of Observations:",
              min = 10, max = 1000, value = 500, step = 50)
)

renderPlot({
  hist_data <- rnorm(input$num_obs)
  hist(hist_data,
       main = paste("Histogram with", input$num_obs, "Observations"),
       xlab = "Value",
       col = "steelblue",
       border = "white")
})
```
